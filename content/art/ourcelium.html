<p>Ourcelium is a fairy ring of interactive mushrooms. Each mushroom is an instrument producing music and light displays when played via an intuitive touch interface. Ourcelium is a proposed art installation for Burning Man 2023.</p>

<p>The installation appears as an elegant fairy ring of mushrooms growing out of the playa. When idle, the mushrooms flow and pulse with soft, inviting, colored light patterns produced by thousands of LEDs under their translucent white surfaces. On the cap of each mushroom there are copper capacitive touch pads. When the pads are touched by participants, a musical sound is triggered in a distinctive voice for that mushroom and a cascade of sparkling colored light coruscates across the entire fairy ring. Participants will have the feeling not only of playing a musical instrument, but a light instrument too. Just as the musical tones harmonize and support each other, the light expressions of each player's mushroom dances and plays across the entire fairy ring in response to their touches. </p>
